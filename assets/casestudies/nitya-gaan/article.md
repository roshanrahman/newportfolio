Somewhere around November 2019, just a few weeks after I had updated my online profiles to include UX/UI as a field I was interested in, I received a connection request on LinkedIn. An Android developer from Mumbai, Chintan, had come across my profile, and wanted help with his project that he wanted to publish and share with his community. 

# What is it about?

Nitya Gaan is a mobile app that allows users to perform their daily religious activity according to the community's practices. It helps users to do so by making available a catalog of prayers or bhajans available that they can access anytime, even offline. It has a reminders section where users can set time for each activity, and the app would then fire an alarm at that time. 

## Existing features

- **Catalog of prayer/bhajan text** for reading, and a few of them accompanied by audio.
- **Alarms for reminding about the daily activities** that the users can enable and set a time for.
- **Localization In Gujarati**, as the community is largely Gujarati. 

# The Problem

Chintan was looking for a designer to help him make the app more user-friendly. When he shared the app to some of his friends and family, he felt that he was having difficulties explaining the interface to them. He wanted it to be intuitive but his users had more questions than he had expected. He was also not pleased with the visual design of the app, and wanted to make it more appealing.

## Capturing pain points in existing app

### The option to switch to Gujarati was difficult to see

It had been implemented as a Floating Action Button (FAB) that forked into two buttons on pressing. They could then choose their language by pressing the button with their language's icon on it. 

- The initial FAB did not have an accompanying label to go with it, and instead only had a globe icon üåê on it. Those unfamiliar with the visual language of iconography could not identify what it would do. Also, FABs work best to present a frequently done action, or the primary action of the app (such as "compose email" or "add note").

- When this FAB was pressed, it split in two, one with a Gujarati character on it, and one with an English/Latin character. This could be difficult for people to see directly, as the size was smaller. 

### The categories of the prayers was not easy to differentiate

The list of categories was implemented as a 2-column grid, and was presented as a tile style button with a large icon on top, and a text label below it. 

- The pattern was difficult to see, as they had to read the labels to identify what the category was. 

- The icon paired with the labels were not contextually fitting. The users could not identify the category solely based on the icons used. 

- The grid was monotonous in color, and the only the icons and labels of each tile were different.

### The UI of reminders did not show the status of the reminders directly

The reminders were implemented to be similar in appearance to the standard Alarm app in Android: A list of horizontal tiles with the time and label on them. 

- The status of the reminders (whether enabled or not) were not visible.

- The option to change the time could be triggered by tapping on the time label. This was conveyed by a popup that would be displayed the first time the user entered the reminder section. This was not a good solution, as it was highly likely that the users might ignore to read the modal dialog's text, or forget what it said.
