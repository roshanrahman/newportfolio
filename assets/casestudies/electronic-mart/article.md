## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```javascript

var hash = require('hash-sum');
var uniq = require('lodash.uniq');

var VueSSRClientPlugin = function VueSSRClientPlugin (options) {
  if ( options === void 0 ) options = {};

  this.options = Object.assign({
    filename: 'vue-ssr-client-manifest.json'
  }, options);
};

VueSSRClientPlugin.prototype.apply = function apply (compiler) {
    var this$1 = this;

  onEmit(compiler, 'vue-client-plugin', function (compilation, cb) {
    var stats = compilation.getStats().toJson();


```

Say what the step will be

And repeat

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
